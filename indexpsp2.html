                        <h2>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)</h2>
                        <p>Los Angeles International Airport, also known as LAX, holds the title of the 
                        busiest airport on the West Coast of the United States. This aviation hub serves as 
                        an international gateway, offering non-stop flights to more than 85 domestic and 
                        69 international destinations. Located in Westchester, a neighborhood in the city 
                        of Los Angeles, LAX is an incredible place for plane spotting due to its 
                        diverse range of aircraft and airlines.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Best Times for Plane Spotting</h3>
                        <p>Plane spotting at LAX is a rewarding experience throughout the year. However, 
                        as with any type of photography, lighting is everything. The golden hours of early 
                        morning and late afternoon provide ideal lighting conditions for capturing 
                        stunning images of aircraft. Furthermore, the sheer volume of traffic at LAX means 
                        that these time windows are filled with a constant stream of diverse aircraft. 
                        Late night spotting can also be rewarding as LAX is a 24/7 operation, with heavy 
                        cargo operations and late-night long-haul departures.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Best Locations for Viewing</h3>
                        <p>The iconic In-N-Out Burger on Sepulveda Boulevard, located just off the 
                        northern runways (24L/24R), is a well-known location for plane spotting. Here, 
                        you can grab a delicious meal while enjoying the spectacle of aircraft on their 
                        final approach, just above your head. For a more panoramic perspective, Imperial 
                        Hill on the southern side of the airport provides excellent views of all four 
                        runways and terminal areas. Clutter's Park is another great spot, offering 
                        fantastic views of departing and arriving aircraft, especially during the 
                        afternoon golden hour.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Types of Aircraft You Can Spot</h3>
                        <p>As one of the major international hubs, LAX showcases a vast array of aircraft. 
                        You can spot short-haul workhorses like the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 series, as 
                        well as long-haul giants such as the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747. A wide range 
                        of airlines from all around the world operate at LAX, giving you the chance to 
                        see a diverse collection of aircraft liveries. From national carriers to low-cost 
                        airlines, cargo giants to boutique operators, LAX hosts them all.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Runway Information</h3>
                        <p>LAX boasts four parallel runways, specifically designed to handle the large 
                        traffic volume. The northern runways, 24L/06R and 24R/06L, are primarily used 
                        for departures, while the southern runways, 25L/07R and 25R/07L, cater mainly to 
                        arrivals. These runways range from 8,925 feet to 12,923 feet in length, making 
                        them capable of accommodating everything from small private jets to large, 
                        wide-body airliners. In addition, each runway is equipped with advanced 
                        instrument landing systems for safe operations in poor visibility conditions.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Flight Radar 24 and LAX</h3>
                        <p>Enhancing your plane spotting experience at LAX is possible with the real-time 
                        flight tracking provided by Flight Radar 24. This useful tool offers detailed 
                        information about each flight, such as its origin, destination, aircraft type, 
                        altitude, and speed. By using Flight Radar 24, you can identify incoming flights, 
                        preparing you for what's coming and allowing you to set up your camera in 
                        advance. Tracking departing flights also provides an exciting insight into where 
                        they are heading, adding an additional layer of depth to your spotting 
                        experience.</p>

                        <h2>Long Beach Airport (LGB) Spotting Guide</h2>
                        <p>
                            Long Beach Airport (LGB) is a different beast compared to its big brother LAX. 
                            It's smaller, quieter, and provides a more intimate spotting experience. LGB, 
                            with its beautiful Streamline Moderne terminal and fewer crowds, offers a more 
                            relaxed plane spotting adventure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The airport is the base for JetBlue's west coast operations, so expect to see a 
                            lot of A320s. You'll also spot FedEx and UPS cargo planes, private jets, and even 
                            vintage aircraft from the adjacent museum.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Best Times for Plane Spotting</h3>
                        <p>
                            As LGB operates under a strict noise ordinance, commercial flights only take off 
                            and land between 7:00 AM and 10:00 PM. These are your spotting hours. JetBlue 
                            flights are most active in the morning (7:00 - 10:00 AM) and evening (6:00 - 10:00 PM).
                        </p>
                        <h3>Best Locations for Viewing</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the best spots is the airport's official viewing area on Wardlow Road, just 
                            west of the runway. It offers unobstructed views of the runway and taxiways. There's 
                            also a grassy area with benches and picnic tables, perfect for a family day out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For a different perspective, head over to Skylinks Golf Course. It's located south 
                            of the airport, and from here, you'll get great views of planes on final approach.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Types of Aircraft You Can Spot</h3>
                        <p>
                            At LGB, JetBlue's Airbus A320s are the main draw. But don't let that fool you. LGB is 
                            also home to Gulfstream Aerospace, so expect to see a lot of Gulfstream business jets. 
                            FedEx and UPS also operate cargo flights, and there's a healthy amount of general 
                            aviation traffic as well. If you're lucky, you might even spot vintage aircraft from 
                            the nearby museum taking to the skies.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Using Flight Radar 24 at LGB</h3>
                        <p>
                            Flight Radar 24 is a useful tool for spotting at LGB. As there are fewer flights 
                            compared to LAX, the app can help you plan your visit better. You'll know exactly when 
                            the next JetBlue flight is arriving or if a FedEx cargo plane is about to take off. 
                            This way, you can make sure you're at the viewing area at the right time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            LGB is a gem of an airport that offers a unique and enjoyable plane spotting experience. 
                            So, next time you're in the area, why not pay it a visit? And remember, patience is key 
                            in plane spotting. Happy spotting!
                        </p>
